Tagging version 1.1


--------------------

Rainrider:
	- Update the scan path
	Artifact scanning is now entirely event driven - no more timers.
	- Fix acquired artifact power calculation
	Values might still be a little off, which is probably a Blizzard bug.
	Closes https://github.com/Rainrider/LibArtifactData-1.0/issues/5
	- Yet another nil check
